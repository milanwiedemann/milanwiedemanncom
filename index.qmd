I'm a researcher and health data scientist at the [Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science](https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford.
I enjoy developing tools in R and Python that help to analyse clinical data and bring evidence into practice:

- [*ehrQL*](https://github.com/opensafely-core/ehrql) is a query language written in Python that our team designed to make it easy to work with electronic health records
- [*suddengains*](https://milanwiedemann.github.io/suddengains/) and [*lcsm*](https://milanwiedemann.github.io/lcsm/) are R packages that my colleagues and I developed to understand changes in clinical measures during psychological therapy
