I'm a researcher at the [Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science](https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford.
I enjoy developing tools that make it easier and more fun to work with clinical data:

- [*suddengains*](https://milanwiedemann.github.io/suddengains/) and [*lcsm*](https://milanwiedemann.github.io/lcsm/) are R packages that my colleagues and I developed to understand changes in clinical measures during psychological therapy
- [*ehrQL*](https://github.com/opensafely-core/ehrql) is a query language written in Python that our team designed to make it easy to work with electronic health records


My work involves using and improving these tools to study changes in clinical measures during psychological therapies ^[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2023.104407)^ ^[2](https://doi.org/10.1037/ccp0000488)^ and to evaluate the quality of clinical care using electronic health records ^[3](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.20.23292883v2)^.
