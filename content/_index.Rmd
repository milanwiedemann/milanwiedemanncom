I'm a data scientist and researcher working in the [DataLab](https://www.thedatalab.org/) at the [Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences](https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/).
My main aim is to develop tools that help to analyse clinical data and bring evidence into practice.

<!-- I enjoy working on [software tools](/software) that help to tidy, analyse, and visualise large datasets. -->
<!-- My main research interest is evidence-based health care, particularly in clinical psychology. -->
<!-- How do we know what works and what doesn't work?  -->
<!-- Why does it work? -->

Before joining the DataLab I completed my DPhil in Experimental Psychology at the Oxford Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma ([OxCADAT](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford-centre-for-anxiety-disorders-and-trauma)) and gained experience analysing routinely collected NHS patient data at the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.
