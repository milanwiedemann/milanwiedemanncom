<p>I’m a PhD candidate at the Oxford Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma (<a href="https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford-centre-for-anxiety-disorders-and-trauma">OxCADAT</a>) at the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford.
My main research interest is evidence-based health care, particularly in clinical psychology.
How do we know what works and what doesn’t work?
Why does it work?</p>
<p>At the moment I’m looking at possible processes through which cognitive therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder might work, see more <a href="/research">here</a>.
In addition to my research interests I’m enjoying to learn about applied statistics and 💜 to create open source <a href="/software">software tools</a> that help to visualise and analyse data.</p>
